## Topic

Characterizing the Gulf of Mexico seawater properties and circulation patterns

## Motivation

The Gulf of Mexico is very intersting region of the world, since it is a semi-enclosed sea with a very strong current system, the Loop Current, which dominates the circulation of the region, since this current varies its penetration depth along the time, finishing with the detachment of very energetic eddies that travel inside the Gulf of Mexico that travels through the region until it is dissipated. Aonther of the interesting features is the Campeche Gyre taht is a semi-permanet ciclonic circulation pattern north of the Veracruz coast. The Gulf of Mexico is also a region of extremely high economic value for both the United States and Mexico, due to abundance of resources such as oil, gas, fisheries, and tourism. And the presence of eddies can disrupt the oil production in the region, due to the strong currents in the sorroundings of some of the oil rigs.

My main interst in the regions and this term paper is to deepen my understanding of the caracteristics of the Loop Current, the eddies that detach from it and the particular properties of waters and circulation in the region.
