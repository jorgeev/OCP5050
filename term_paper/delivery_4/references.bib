The conditions are favorable for the Loop to shed eddies in summer and winter when strong trade winds in the Caribbean produce large Yucatan transport and Loop's intrusion, and concurrently when weak easterlies in the Gulf offer little impediment to eddy shedding. The conditions are less favorable in fall and spring as the trade winds and Yucatan transport weaken, and the strengthening of the Gulf's easterlies impedes shedding.},

	abstract = {The Gulf of Mexico exhibits strong circulation due to the Loop Current System, along with high mesoscale eddy activity. In order to investigate eddy characteristics, we apply an automatic eddy-tracking algorithm to absolute dynamic topography maps and analyze the spatial distribution and evolution of eddy attributes including amplitude, radius, and eddy kinetic energy. The Loop Current region in the eastern Gulf of Mexico is an area of robust eddy generation for both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Anticyclonic eddies were generally characterized by smaller amplitudes and larger radii when compared to their cyclonic counterparts. We also examine eddy surface properties including temperature and salinity anomalies as well as chlorophyll-a concentration and observe how these properties vary between the eastern and western Gulf of Mexico. Persistent features such as the Loop Current System and coastal low-salinity, highly biologically productive waters dominate eddy properties in the eastern side of the basin. We also apply the eddy-tracking algorithm to a regional Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model validated using Argo floats. We find that this model accurately reflects surface characteristics in the mesoscale eddy field as well as the mean vertical eddy structure and use it to extend our analysis of eddy properties with depth. We find that subsurface characteristics of density, salinity, temperature, and velocities vary greatly between eddies in the eastern and western Gulf of Mexico. Through composite analysis of both surface and subsurface eddy properties, we gain a more complete picture of the mechanisms behind the observable characteristics of these eddies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Often there is a need to consider spatial weighting in methods for finding spatial patterns in climate data. The focus of this paper is on techniques that maximize variance, such as empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). A weighting matrix is introduced into a generalized framework for dealing with spatial weighting. One basic principal in the design of the weighting matrix is that the resulting spatial patterns are independent of the grid used to represent the data. A weighting matrix can also be used for other purposes, such as to compensate for the neglect of unrepresented subgrid-scale variance or, in the form of a prewhitening filter, to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of EOFs. The new methodology is applicable to other types of climate pattern analysis, such as extended EOF analysis and maximum covariance analysis. The increasing availability of large datasets of three-dimensional gridded variables (e.g., reanalysis products and model output) raises special issues for data-reduction methods such as EOFs. Fast, memory-efficient methods are required in order to extract leading EOFs from such large datasets. This study proposes one such approach based on a simple iteration of successive projections of the data onto time series and spatial maps. It is also demonstrated that spatial weighting can be combined with the iterative methods. Throughout the paper, multivariate statistics notation is used, simplifying implementation as matrix commands in high-level computing languages.},

The book is self contained: introductory material, standard advanced techniques, and the specialised techniques used specifically by climatologists are all contained within this one source. There are a wealth of real-world examples drawn from the climate literature to demonstrate the need, power and pitfalls of statistical analysis in climate research. Suitable for graduate courses on statistics for climatic, atmospheric and oceanic science, this book will also be valuable as a reference source for researchers in climatology, meteorology, atmospheric science, and oceanography.},
