1. Introduction
   - Background of the Gulf of Mexico
        - Physical properties of the Gulf of Mexico.
        - Main upper-layer circulations in the Gulf of Mexico
            - The importance of the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico and the eddie shedding process
            - Campeche Gyre the secondary ciclonic gyre in the Gulf of Mexico
        - Main lower-layer circulations in the Gulf of Mexico
            - Deep Gulf Current the deep current in the Gulf of Mexico
            - Sigsbee Plain Gyre in the Gulf of Mexico
            - Boundary Current the boundary current in the Gulf of Mexico
   - Motivation of the study
   - Objective of the study

2. Data and Methods
   - Data source
       - HYCOM model
       - HYCOM free run simulation configuration, including the boundary conditions and resolution of the model.
       - Relationship between isopycnal surfaces and ocean profiles
   - Complex Empirical Orthogonal Functions (CEOF) analysis

3. Results
   - Phase and amplitude of the CEOF modes and their relationship with the upper and lower layer patterns
   - Time series of the PCA
   - Analysis of the reconstructed fields againts the full model fields

4. Discussion
    - Comparison against Olvera-Prado et al. (2023), compare similarities and differences in the explained variance, phase and amplitude of the first 4 modes.
    - Also compare the time series of the PCA to verify if they capture cyclical behaviors that can qualify as recurrent.

5. Conclusion
