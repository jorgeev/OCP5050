## 1. The Momentum Equation

a) Given the momentum equation below, explain what each term in the equation represents and how it relates to movement in the ocean

$$
\frac{\partial \overrightarrow{v}}{\partial t} + \overrightarrow{v} \cdot \nabla \overrightarrow{v} + f \hat{k} \times \overrightarrow{v} = -\frac{1}{\rho_0} \nabla P + \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial z} - g\hat{k}
$$

- $\frac{\partial \overrightarrow{v}}{\partial t}$ is the acceleration of the fluid, since it's the derivative of the velocity with respect to time of the ocean.
- $\overrightarrow{v} \cdot \nabla \overrightarrow{v}$ is the advective term, which represent the transport of momentum in the ocean
- $f \hat{k} \times \overrightarrow{v}$ is the Coriolis term, describing the effect of the rotation of the Earth on the ocean, that is apparent as a deflection in the direction of the motion of the fluid it is to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, also it is stronger in the Polar Regions and weaker in the Equator.
- $-\frac{1}{\rho_0} \nabla P$ is the pressure gradient force term, it describes the tendency of the fluid to move from high pressure to low pressure.
- $\frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{\partial \tau}{\partial z}$ is the wind stress term, it describes the effect of the wind on the ocean.
- $-g\hat{k}$ is the gravity term, it describes the force due to the gravity. It points downwards towards the center of mass of the Earth.

b) What physical law is the momentum equation a statement of?

The second law of Newton's motion, which enforces the conservation of momentum in a fluid.

## 2. Pressure Gradient Force

Using the image above, compute the following:

a) The zonal pressure gradient force across the Pacific Ocean at 25$^\circ$N. In what direction does it point?

The Pressure Gradient Force points the right direction since the highest SSH is located in at the left margin of the Pacific Ocean.

b) The zonal pressure gradient force across the Atlantic Ocean at 25$^\circ$N. In what direction does it point?

In the Atlantic Ocean the Pressure Gradient Force points to the right direction since the highest SSH is located in at the left margin of the Atlantic Ocean.

c) The zonal pressure gradient force across the Indian Ocean at the Equator. In what direction does it point?

In the Indian Ocean the Pressure Gradient Force points to the left and is very small since the SSH is very similar in the whole region but slightly higher in the right margin.

## 3. Thermal Wind

The schematic below represents the zonal geostrophic velocity shear in a location in the Southern Hemisphere.

![Schematic of zonal geostrophic velocity shear in the Southern Hemisphere](images/zonalwind.png){#fig:zonalwind width=50%}

a) Make a corresponding sketch showing a plausible horizontal pressure gradient in each layer such that when the layers are compared in the vertical, the resulting structure could give rise to the shear in the schematic. In your sketch, make sure you label the directions of increasing z, etc (in other words, the sign of the horizontal pressure gradient must be obvious from your sketch).

View the sketch in figure \ref{fig:pressuregradient}.

b) Briefly describe the general direction of the horizontal density gradient above and below the level of no motion.

Since we are working on the Southern Hemisphere, Coriolis force always has a negative sign $f < 0$. In the lower levels we have a negative zonal velocity $u < 0$, so the horizontal pressure gradient must ve positive $dp/dy > 0$, in order to get the correct direction of the zonal velocity, we have to have the high pressure to south. As we get closer to the no motion level, the gradient has to become closer to zero, so the isobar hast to be almost completely horizontal.

At high altitude we have positive zonal velocity $u > 0$, so the horizontal pressure gradient must be negative $dp/dy < 0$, in order to get the correct direction of the zonal velocity, we need to have the high pressure to north and the low pressure to south, and as we descend closer to the no motion level, the gradient has to become smaller and smaller until it becomes zero at the no motion level, between $z_2$ and $z_3$.
