1. Which map appears to look more like the true surface ocean circulation? Why do you expect this to be the case?

    The Surface Current Speed (\ref{fig:current-speed}) and the Meridional Velocity (\ref{fig:meridional-velocity}) maps appear to look more like the true surface ocean circulation. This may be due to that the predominance of the zonal velocity across the whole globe in the global scale, in the south hemisphere we can also clearly identify the Antarctic Circumpolar Current with a very strong Eastward signal. However, when we are talking about the boundary currents, the meridional velocity show more clearly the prescence of this current since the circulation in these regions have a strong meridional component, northward in the Northern Hemisphere and southward in the Southern Hemisphere.

2. Examine your 3500 m ocean current speed map. Focusing on the Atlantic, which
feature of the deep horizontal circulation is most prominent in this region? Given what you know about deep water sources in the Atlantic Ocean, what is the general direction of this flow in each hemisphere?

    In the Deep Currents Speed map (\ref{fig:deep-current-speed}) we can clearly see the Gulf Stream in the Northern Hemisphere and the Brazil Current in the Southern Hemisphere, in the Atlantic Ocean region. Also in the Southern Hemisphere we can see the Antarctic Circumpolar Current have a very deep penetration in the ocean, reaching depths of around 3500 meters, and I supposer that the high speed is also related to the Antartic Bottom Water formation in the region that pushes the bottom water to move in the deep ocean.

1. Explain the subtropical and subpolar gyre circulation in the North Pacific Ocean. Be sure to reference  each of the above plots, and you must discuss 1) the wind-driven ocean forcing, 2) Ekman transport, 3) geostrophic balance, 4) Sverdrup balance, 5) western intensification and western boundary currents, and 6) the total gyre transport.

    In figure \ref{fig:zonal-wind-stress} we can observe the global mean zonal wind stress, in the North Pacific Ocean we can split the region in 2 large patterns, close to thye equator between 0 to 30N (tropics) we observe a very strong negative wind stress signal and between 30N to 60N (mid latitudes) the wind stress is positive, this causes that in the tropical regions the water masses are pushed to the wester region of the pacific ocean, which we can observe in the SSH map (fig \ref{fig:mean-sea-surface-height}), where we can observe very high ssh offshore of Japan and China regions, this pilling of water offshore causes that the water masses are pushed down in the deep ocean, the downwelling due to the Ekman pumping, and also a transport effect tha pushes the water to the right, moving the water masses to the northward creating the Kuroshio Current, which then is pushed to the east by the positive wind stress signal, this causes the formation of the subtropical gyre.

    This is consistent with the Sverdrup transport map (fig \ref{fig:sverdrup-transport}), where we can observe that it is consitent with the wind stress pattern, the transport is negative in the central region of the Pacific gyre which signal a south ward transport of water masses, and close to the equator this ispositive signaling a northward transport as well as in the north region between 45N to 75M and also we can se a positive transport in the western boundary current that is consisten with what we would expect from the gyre circulation pattern in the north pacific ocean.

    This patterns can be summarized in the barotropic streamfunction map (fig \ref{fig:mean-barotropic-streamfunction}), where we can observe a very strong positive transport in the region between 15N to 35N that shows the subtropical gyre circulation position, representing the integrated  anticyclonic gyre circulation generated by the interaction of the wind stress and the Coriolis force.

2. Place the January and June plots of the barotropic streamfunction below. Briefly compare the differences between your two plots. What is the most likely reason that the streamfunction would vary over the course of the year?

    ![January Barotropic Stream Function](images/january_barotropic_streamfunction.png){#fig:january-barotropic-streamfunction height=45%}

    ![June Barotropic Stream Function](images/june_barotropic_streamfunction.png){#fig:june-barotropic-streamfunction height=45%}

    Overall, the to plot show a very similar pattern, with a few differences in the latitudes between 15N to 35N, we can observa that the extension of the positive transport in the regions is much wider in the January plot (fig \ref{fig:january-barotropic-streamfunction}) than in the June plot (fig \ref{fig:june-barotropic-streamfunction}). This is likely due to the fact that the wind stress is stronger in the Northern Hemisphere in January than in June, causing the ocean to flow in a counter-clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere.

    Also, in the june plot (fig \ref{fig:june-barotropic-streamfunction}) we can observe that the transport close to the equator is much more negative during this time of the year andclose to the equator between 170W to 100W we can observe a very strong positve transport signal that is much weaker in the january plot. These resposne might be related to the increase in the trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere in the summer season.

## Meridional Overturning Circulation

![Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation](images/Atlantic_MOC.png){#fig:atlantic-moc height=45%}

![Indo-Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation](images/Indian-Pacific_MOC.png){#fig:indo-pacific-moc height=45%}

- Compare your two overturning plots. In a very broad sense, what is similar between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific plots? What is different? Why do you expect the Indo-Pacific plot to have a weak or non-existent upper overturning cell in comparison to the Atlantic plot?

    In both plot we observe kind of the same pattern, the upper region show a northward upper overturning cell and a southward lower overturning cell. However, as mentioned in the question, the Indo-Pacific plot shows  a almost not exitent patter, it is very very weak, and also it doesn't reach al the way to the -30S latitude, it breakes around the -25S latitude. although, the depth of the upper limb is about the same ~2000 - ~3000m. Another notorios diferent is that the lower limb is the Indo-Pacific plot shows a stronger signal between the -20S to 20N latitude. Another very distinctive pattern in the Indo-Pacific plot is that the strongest circulations both negative and positive ocurrs both in the very shallow region , probabli in the first 200m in the region bounded  by the -23S to 20N latitude, so this suggests that the probably the overturning in this regionis very shallow so it depends mostly by the trade winds and wind stress in the equatorial and subtropical regions, so this effect does not propagates deep into the ocean. While in the Atlantic Ocean we encounter the AMOC that is much more energetically intense that comes from the deep water formation in the north atlantic ocean, while in the North Pacific Ocean we don't have water mass formation in the deep ocean.

## Global Meridional Ocean Heat Transport

![Global Meridional Ocean Heat Transport](images/Global_heat_transport.png){#fig:global-heat-transport height=45%}

The plot of the global meridional ocean heat transport (fig \ref{fig:global-heat-transport}) generaly summarized the transport of heat in the ocean, in the Southern hemisphere it shows a negative transport, it is negative because the gyre circulation, what is why the minimum is located around -20S that is the approximate position of south hemisphere gyres and they are pushing the heat to the south pole, however this transport is about half of the transport in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Northern hemisphere the transport is way stronger reaching almost 2.5 PW in the region between 0N to 20N, also consistent with the position of the subtropical gyres in the northern hemisphere. So, in general this plot show how the heat is moved from the equator and tropics to the poles.
