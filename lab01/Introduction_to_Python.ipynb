When you are done editing, press Shift+Return on your keyboard. Try this with the code cell below:"

    "Python is a language, and inside every language there are different types of words. In English, we have parts of speech like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. In Python, we have *packages* like Numpy, Xarray, Matplotlib, etc. Each package has a specific purpose:\n",
    "* Numpy is all about matrices, lists, and math operations on those matrices and lists.\n",
    "* Xarray is a powerful Python library designed for working with multi-dimensional labeled datasets, often used in fields such as climate science, oceanography, and remote sensing. It provides a high-level interface for manipulating and analyzing datasets that can be thought of as extensions of NumPy arrays. Xarray is particularly useful for geospatial data because it supports labeled axes (dimensions), coordinates, and metadata, making it easier to work with datasets that vary across time, space, and other dimensions.\n",
    "* Matplotlib is a plotting package. But I didn't import all of Matplotlib, I only imported one *module* from Matplotlib called pyplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't automatically open all packages when you start a notebook or script. Instead, you need to tell Python which packages you want. You do this with the import statement. You can also give each package a nickname, like \"np\" in the example below. Here are some more examples of importing packages."

    "**Array Type:** The very first thing that is shown in the above print out is 'xarray.Dataset'. There are two main types of arrays that xarray can handle: DataArrays and Datasets. A Dataset is a collection of DataArrays. Imagine that a DataArray is a rubix cube. It is a 3D (or 2D or 4D or however shaped) array of data. A Dataset would therefore be a collection of rubix cubes. Imagine you ordered a shipment of 30 rubix cubes. Each individual rubix cube is a DataArray, and the box that all the cubes were shipped in is the Dataset. We can select one DataArray using its variable name. There are some data selection methods that only work on DataArrays, which is why it is important to distinguish between DataArrays and Datasets.\n",
