## Atlantic Ocean

![Atlantic Ocean](images/Atlantic_section_txt.jpg){#fig:Atlantic-Ocean}

In figure \ref{fig:Atlantic-Ocean}.a we can observe the Atlantic Ocean temperature, in this figure we can observe that the highest temperatures are around the equator, but in this region the temperature declines very fast as we go deeper. However aroun 10N to 45 degrees in both directions, north and south, We observe other regions with highes temepratures, and even when they are cooler than the ecuator, they decay much slower with depth, so we still have some regions with temperatures ~20 degrees Celsius at almost 1000 meters depth. The lowest temperatures can be observed in general in the southernmost part of the Atlantic Ocean, with temperatures even below 0 degrees Celsius. And also very high in the north, above the 20N.

In figure \ref{fig:Atlantic-Ocean}.b we can observe the Atlantic Ocean practical salinity, in the figure we can observe 2 maximums of salinity in the upper layers of the ocean, both centered around the 20 degrees latitude, one in the north and one in the south. However is notorious that just below the southern maximum in exist a very notorious low salinity that extentds from the surface around the 50S until reaching a depth of around 1000 meters and extends at this depth all the way to the ecuator and even a little bit to the north. The salinity minimum can be found in the surface region close to the north pole.

In figure \ref{fig:Atlantic-Ocean}.c we can observe the Atlantic Ocean oxygen, we can see a very notorios oxygen minimum in the subsurface region centered around the ecuator and extending up to around 1000 meters depth and extending between 20S to 20N. In the south just next to this region we can observe a very high oxygen that seems to com from the surface region of the southernmost part of the Atlantic Ocean and it start to sink around the 50Sand continue traveling to the north. Also the depth of this high oxygen region seems to be blocked by another low oxigen structure located even deeper that seems to extentd and fuse whit the ecuator region oxygen minimum. The north pole seem to show a very high consentration in general along the full water column.

## Pacific Ocean

![Pacific Ocean](images/Pacific_section_txt.jpg){#fig:Pacific-Ocean}

According to figure 14.11 in Tally, there seems exist deep water formation regions in the pacific Ocean

In figure \ref{fig:Pacific-Ocean}.a we have the Pacific Ocean temperature, again we can obseve a similar surface temperature distribution as the Atlantic Ocean, with a very high temperature region around the equator that decays fast as we go deeper, followed by a region of high temperature between 10N to 45N and 10S to 45S that also exhihit a slower decay with depth. Bun in this case it is less simetrical, since the souther ocean is show an even slower decay with depth. The temperature maximumx in this case are not in the deep ocean but in the surface region in both the northern and southern poles between 60 to 80 degrees latitude, in their corresponding hemisphere.

In figure \ref{fig:Pacific-Ocean}.b we show the Pacific Ocean practical salinity. The freshest regions is located in the northernmost region of the pacific ocean between 70 to 90 degrees, and only in the surface. The saltiest water seems to be located in 2 subsurface regions in the north and the south, in the first 500 meters depth, both around the 20 degrees latitude, one in the north and one in the south. The one in the south seem to be stronger and extends deeper than the one in the north, and it seems to be blocked by a low salinity region located deeper.

The oxygen concentration in the Pacific Ocean, figure \ref{fig:Pacific-Ocean}.c,  show more the most variability. In the North tropical region we can observe a very low oxygen subsurface region between the 0N to 60N, this region seems to be pushed down in the region between 20 to 40 degrees latitude, in the surace region by a very high oxygen region, However this one doesn't reach beyond the first 1000 meters depth. So the low oxygen region dominates the deep ocean. However we can observe a very large gradient of oxygen in this region, the ocean becomes slighly more oxygenated as we go deeper. On the contrary in the South tropical region we can observe a very high oxygen region between the 0S to 60S taht reach almost 1000m depth in the deep regions. But this one seems to be blocked by a slighly low oxygen region located below, however it doesn't seem to be very low, and ingeeral the south pacific is much more oxygenated than the north pacific.

## Pacific vs. Atlantic Section Differences

![Atlantic and Pacific Oceans](images/Section_comparison.jpg){#fig:Section-Comparison}

In figure \ref{fig:Section-Comparison}.a we can observe that the surface temperature in the upper layer of the South of the Pacific, between 40S to 60S, is overall hotter than the Atlantic Ocean, between the surface and the first 1000 meters, also in general in all the southern deep pacific is over all slighly hotter, on the contrary the pacific oceanis over all hotter in the norther part oar an we can observe a considerably hotter region between thw 10N to 60N that and a depth 200m to almost 2000 meters depth water mass that is over all hotter in the Atlantic Ocean. Around the ecuator in the surface and the first 500 meters depth the pacific ocean show a much higher temperature than the Atlantic Ocean, however in the intermediate and deep ocean, between 1000 to 4000 meters depth the Atlantic ocean us slightly hotter than the pacific, and in the very deep ocean between 4000 to 5500 meters in the latitudes between 10S to 30S the Pacific shows slightly hotter temperature than the Atlantic.

In the absolute salinity comparison figure \ref{fig:Section-Comparison}.b, we can observe that the Norther Atlantic is saltier than the North Pacific, specially in the first 2000 meters depth, around the ecuator in the surface the Atlantic Ocean is again considerably saltier than the Pacific Ocean, but is is very notorius that in the subsurface region of the ecuator, between the 200m to 500m there is a very salty region in the Pacific that is not present in the Atlantic Ocean. In the South, between 40S to 60S, we observe a very ostrong salinity region in the upper layer of the South Pacific that is not present in the Atlantic Ocean. On the intermediate and deep ocean, in the southern region the pacific is saltier than the Atlantic ocean.

In the oxygen difference comparison figure \ref{fig:Section-Comparison}.c, we can observe that over all the Altantic is much more oxygenated than the Pacific Ocean, specialy in the region between 30N to 55N, in the intermediate Ocean. However, this make very notorious that there are some subsuperficial regions in the Pacific Ocean that are much more oxygenated than the Atlantic Ocean, all of them doesn't reach beyond the first 1000 meters depth.

## T-S Diagram Atlantic Oceans

![T-S Diagram Atlantic Oceans](images/T-S_diagram_Atlantic.jpg){#fig:T-S-Diagram-Atlantic}

In the T-S diagram for the Atlantic Oceans, figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Atlantic}.a shows the T-S diagram for the north Atlantic, figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Atlantic}.b shows the T-S diagram for the south Atlantic and figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Atlantic}.c shows the comparison between the north and south Atlantic. Here we can observe that the north atlanting has a higher minimum salinity than the south atlantic, and also a higher maximum salinity, so in general saltier than the south atlantic. Also we can observe a taht there a considerable more number of low density and high temperature regions along the north atlantic transect that are not present in the south atlantic, were we na only observe very few points with density below that 25. Also the north Atlantic sea seems to be warmer than the south Atlantic sea. In the profile comparison figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Atlantic}.c we can clearly see how the north Atlantic exhibits an over all denser water mass than the south Atlantic, and warmer since the points does not reach the same temperature as the south Atlantic.

## T-S Diagram Pacific Oceans

![T-S Diagram Pacific Oceans](images/T-S_diagram_Pacific.jpg){#fig:T-S-Diagram-Pacific}

In the T-S diagram for the Pacific Oceans, figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Pacific}.a shows the T-S diagram for the north Pacific, figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Pacific}.b shows the T-S diagram for the south Pacific and figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Pacific}.c shows the comparison between the north and south Pacific. Here we can se that the South pacific is much saltier than the North pacific, and slightly colder in the bottom layers, but surprisely also warmer in the surface layers, so in general it is very notorious to have higher overall density in the south pacific. In the profile comparison figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Pacific}.c this is very evident. Also South Pacific Ocean seem to show a much less variaton in salinity than the North Pacific.

## T-S Diagram Atlantic and Pacific Oceans

![T-S Diagram Atlantic and Pacific Oceans](images/T-S_diagram_Comparison.jpg){#fig:T-S-Diagram-Comparison}

In figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Comparison}.a we can observe the T-S diagram for the Pacific Ocean, figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Comparison}.b shows the T-S diagram for the Atlantic Ocean and figure \ref{fig:T-S-Diagram-Comparison}.c shows the comparison between the Pacific and Atlantic.

The warmest overall ocean seems to be the North Atlantic, since it show both the higher low temperature and also highest high temperature regions. This seems to bee also the saltiest ocean. It si followed by the North Atlantic, that is also the saltier than the Pacific sections, in most of the ocean, except between the 1000 to 2000 meters depth where the salinity decreases and is similar to the Pacific Ocean. Above the 1000 meters the South Atlantic and South Pacific show a nice overlap in salinity and temperature and density, this makes sense since there is water exchange between the two oceans, so it reflected here

The third denses section seems to be the South Pacific, as mentioned above, it shows some paterns that are similar to the South Atlantic, but is also show a very wide variation in salinity compared to the Atlantic Ocean sections.

Finally, we have the North Pacific, that over all seems to be the freshest of all the sections we analyzed, the largest variation in salinity is located between the surface and the first 1000 meters depth. This sections is also the one coldest in the surface  and upper levels and the second warmest in the bottom.
